=head1 DESCRIPTION

Show help on particular command (if it is provided), or general information about Serge.
By default (and depending on your operating system), it will try to open an HTML version
of the help in your browser. Otherwise it will render a plain-text version in the console.

For the list of available commands, just run C<serge> with no command-line parameters.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--console>

Do not try to open HTML help in browser; render help in console instead.

=item B<--no-pager>

When in console mode, do not try to use a pager. By default, Serge tries to use C<less>
or C<more>. The pager command can be overwritten by C<SERGE_PAGER> or C<PAGER> environment
variables. To permanently disable the pager in Serge, set C<SERGE_PAGER> to C<0>.
