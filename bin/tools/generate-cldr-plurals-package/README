This script will generate CLDRPlurals.pm Perl module, which will contain mappings of locales
to their supported plural forms as they are described in CLDR.

To update against latest CLDR:

1. Download latest `core.zip` file from CLDR website:

    http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/ => <latest.version>/ => core.zip

2. Extract `supplemental/plurals.xml` from `core.zip` into this directory

3. Run:

    $ perl generate-cldr-plurals-package.pl

The generated file will be saved as `<Serge-root>/lib/Serge/Util/CLDR/CLDRPlurals.pm`.
